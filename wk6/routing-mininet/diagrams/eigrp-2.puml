activate RouterX

RouterX -> RouterY: Update Packet (Advertised Distance)
RouterY -> RouterY: Check Feasibility Condition (Advertised Distance < Feasible Distance)
alt Feasible
    RouterY -> RouterY: Add Route to Topology Table (Feasible Successor)
    RouterY -> RouterZ: Update Packet (Advertised Distance)
else Not Feasible
    RouterY -> RouterY: Add Route to Topology Table (Successor)
end
