  Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest paths from a source vertex in a weighted graph.

  Args:
      graph: A dictionary representing the graph. Keys are vertices, values are dictionaries

      source: The starting vertex for the shortest path search.

  Returns:
      A dictionary containing the distance to each vertex from the source and the predecessor
      vertex in the shortest path (for path reconstruction). None if there are negative edges.
