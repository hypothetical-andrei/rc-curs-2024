def bellman_ford(graph, source):
  """
  Implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find shortest paths from a source vertex.

  Args:
      graph: A dictionary representing the graph. Keys are vertices, values are dictionaries
             with neighbors as keys and edge weights as values.
      source: The starting vertex for the shortest path search.

  Returns:
      A dictionary containing the distance to each vertex from the source and the predecessor
      vertex in the shortest path (for path reconstruction). None if a negative cycle is detected.
